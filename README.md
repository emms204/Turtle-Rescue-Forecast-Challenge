# Turtle-Rescue-Forecast-Challenge
The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to help Kenyan non-profit organization Local Ocean Conservation anticipate the number of turtles they will rescue from each of their rescue sites as part of their By-Catch Release Programme.  The data used to train the model will be historic data on the number of turtles rescued from each site from 1998 until 2018. To date, Local Ocean Conservation has released over 10,000 sea turtles.  An accurate prediction will enable Local Ocean Conservation to allocate staff and resources more efficiently.
